## Lab

### Log into Jira

Your instructor should provide you the URL and credentials to log into a Jira instance.  The Jira instance is already configured to integrate with Bitbucket.

### Create a branch from Jira

In Jira, click on `Projects` in the top menu bar, then select `View All Projects` in the sub-menu.  This will display all the projects in Jira.  

Click on the "Teams in Space" project link.  The default view should be a list of issues in the project.  If that is not showing, click on `Issues` in the left menu panel.

Select an issue that strikes your fancy.  You can expand the issue details by clicking on the `Expand Issue` icon in the upper right of the issue details panel.  Alternatively, click on the issue ticket number (e.g., `TIS-10`) at the top of the issue details panel.

In the issue details view, scroll down to find the "Development" subsection on the right.  Below that should be a `Create branch` link.  Click it.  The browser page will switch to the Create Branch page in Bitbucket.
