## Lab

### Watch a repository

Go to the "Bitbucket Lab" repository.

Click on the `Watch` button in the upper right of the page.  This shows a "Watch" dialog box.  

Set the fields for watching this repository:
* Pushes - Leave as "Default branch".
* Pull requests - Change to "All pull request activity".

Click `Save` in the dialog box.  Notice that the button has changed to `Watching` in the upper right of the page.

Now click on your user avatar icon on the right end of the top menu bar of the page.  In the drop-down menu, select `Manage account`.

On the "Account" page, click on the `Watched repositories` menu item in the left menu panel.

The "Watched repositories" pages should show that you are watching the "Bitbucket Lab" repository.  Notice that you could edit your watch settings for the repository here.

Click on the `Notification settings` menu item in the left menu panel.  On the "Notification settings" page, you could optionally change the settings to receive emailed notifications immediately instead of in periodic batches.

### Examine Bitbucket logs

#### Push logs

Go back to the "Bitbucket Lab" repository.

Click on the `Repository settings` menu item in the left menu panel.

Click on `Push logs` in the Repository settings menu.

Notice that for the "main" branch there are a couple of actions that were done as part of an earlier lab.  Change the branch to "feature-lab-2.3", and notice that more actions are shown.

#### Repository audit logs

Click on `Audit logs` in the Repository settings menu.

Scroll through the audit log to see the access history of the repository.

#### Project audit logs

Go to the "Training Labs" project.

Click on the `Project settings` menu item in the left menu panel.

Click on `Audit logs` in the Project settings menu.

Scroll through the audit log and experiment with some of the search options.  Click on the `+ More` button to add more search options.

### Advanced search

In the search box in the blue top menu bar, type "readme" and then hit `return` key.  Notice what shows up.  Try typing in some text you added to your files in the labs and see if you can find that text.
